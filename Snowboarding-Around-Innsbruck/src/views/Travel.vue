      Welcome to the Travel Guidance page. I will explain the travel apps I used
      on my trip. You will find out how to get from Munich to Innsbruck. Learn
      how to use the local public transport system to get from the main
      Innsbruck station to your accommodations. At the end will be explaining my
      two main bus stations and some tips for how to use the bus system.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>
        First thing I will describe is recommended apps to have for travel. OBB
        Tickets, bergfex Ski, Omio, and Hotels Tonight.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>OBB Tickets</strong> is the main app used for the trains in
      Austria. When you open the app you will see "Timetable & Tickets" with a
      search icon at the top of the screen. Click this. From you will enter the
      places you need to travel between, the date you wish to go, the departing
      time, and who the passenger is. The next screen you select the best ticket
      for you. Make sure to buy train tickets as the ticket checker walks
      between cars, verifying all passengers. You will see an example of this
      app below in the getting from Munich to Innsbruck section.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>bergfex Ski</strong> is the ultimate snow resort app for weather
      information pertaining to the resorts. When you open the app it will take
      you right to a overview of your favorites. I recommend searching the app
      for the resots you plan to visit and add them to your favorites. The
      overview gives you webcam views and a 5 day weather forecast. Clicking on
      each individual resort will give you a map, lifts open, the weather,
      webcams, and more information for your trip. You are also able to see the
      current day ticket price. These can change pending on when you visit.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Omio</strong> is a app similiar to OBB Tickets but for travel
      throughout more of Europe. The opening page will ask you where you want to
      go, from where, date, and who is going. This is the main app I use for
      traveling from country to country. It was what I used to go from Munich to
      Innsbruck.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Hotels Tonight</strong> is a app I use when traveling. This app is
      great to find last day bookings for cheap hotel rooms. Enter your city and
      date, then choose which is best for you.
    </p>

      <strong>From Munich to Innsbruck</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      When I started this trip I flew from the United States to Munich, Germany.
      Munich is the closest & largest international airport to Innsbruck. To get
      from the airport to Innsbruck I used the Omio app. The train dropped me
      off at the Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof in the center of town. Below is an
      example of my search and the trip I chose to take. There is one transfer
      and this was the quickest route for me. This cost $77.

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Next up I will explain the Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof. Hauptbahnhof meaning
      "main station". This station has been operating since 1853. It is one of
      the oldest and busiest stations in Austria. At Innsbruck Central Station,
      most trains depart from the platform (No. 1-7) and are divided into areas
      A, B, C and D. On the departure screen, you will see the various trains
      entering and leaving the station through these areas and the platform. The
      train departs from the upper level, so there are two passenger passages
      under the platform that can be used to enter the train from the departure
      hall. When taking the train from Innsbruck Central Station, please pay
      special attention to which station area your train will leave. Below you
      will see a photo of the inside of the main station. The departure screen
      is located on the south side of the building at the top of the stairs. It
      is shown in the distance. Beside it you will see a layout of the building.
      You can see the train lines, the building, and the bus stops on the
      opposite side.

      After that I need to describe the different bus lines, bus stations, and
      trams around town. Here you'll find tips and resources for your travels.
      This will include main bus and train routes.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Lastly, all routes I use will be based from Innsbruck Landessportscenter &
      Tivoli Stadion. Below you will see a photo of the two stops. The one on
      the bottom, or the lower one, is Innsbruck Landessportscenter and all
      buses here go South. The one on the top, or higher one, in the photo is
      Tivoli Stadion. All buses from here go North.
    </p>

    />
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Some key tips for the bus system. Arrive 2 minutes early before scheduled
      time on the app. The buses can run slightly ahead of or behind schedule.
      When at the bus stop, read either the paper sign or look for the electric
      sign stating the bus routes that stop here. Verify the bus route you want
      if you are unsure. When the bus arrives, the doors may not open. There
      will be a "< >" button you press to open the doors. Find a seat or stand
      depending on how busy it is. There is normally a video board at the front
      of the bus indicating the upcoming stop. Watch for you stop. When
      approaching the stop, you need to press the square "STOP" buttons located
      throughout the bus. If this is not pressed the bus driver may skip your
      stop to get in better time with the route schedule. When nearing your
      stop, exit the bus and continue on your journey.
