      Welcome to the Travel Guidance page. I will explain the travel apps I used
      on my trip. You will find how to get from Munich to Innsbruck. Using the
      local public transport system to get from the main Innsbruck station to
      your accommodations. At the end will be explaining my two main bus
      stations and some tips for how to use the bus system.
    </p>
    <h3>
      First thing I will describe is recommended apps to have for travel. Omio &
      OBB Tickets.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Then I describe and show how to train from Munich to Innsbruck. Next up I
      will explain the Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof. Hauptbahnhof meaning "main
      station". After that I need to describe the different bus lines, bus
      stations, and trams around town. Here you'll find tips and resources for
      your travels. This will include main bus and train routes.
    </h3>

      Lastly, all routes I use will be based from Innsbruck Landessportscenter &
      Tivoli Stadion. Below you will see a photo of the two stops. The one on
      the bottom, or the lower one, is Innsbruck Landessportscenter and all
      buses here go South. The one on the top, or higher one, in the photo is
      Tivoli Stadion. All buses from here go North.

    <p>
      Some key tips for the bus system. Arrive 2 minutes early before scheduled
      time on the app. The buses can run slightly ahead of or behind schedule.
      When at the bus stop, read either the paper sign or look for the electric
      sign stating the bus routes that stop here. Verify the bus route you want
      if you are unsure. When the bus arrives, the doors may not open. There
      will be a "< >" button you press to open the doors. Find a seat or stand
      depending on how busy it is. There is normally a video board at the front
      of the bus indicating the upcoming stop. Watch for you stop. When
      approaching the stop, you need to press the square "STOP" buttons located
      throughout the bus. If this is not pressed the bus driver may skip your
      stop to get in better time with the route schedule. When nearing your
      stop, exit the bus and continue on your journey.
