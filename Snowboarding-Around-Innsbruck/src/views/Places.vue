    <h1>Places to Check Out</h1>
    <p>
      Hot spots are recommendations of places to check out in the city. You'll
      find listed here restaurants, pubs, and some music venues. I'll have a
      review of what I ordered, pricing, and overall atmosphere detail. There
      will also be a variety of businesses listed here I used, some historical
      sites to check, and art galleries.
