    <p>
      Welcome to Innsbruck Austria. Innsbruck is the capitol of the federal
      state of Tyrol. With a population of 136k this city is a top destination
      for sports enthusiasts. Especially in the winters for all things snow
      related. Whether you are a snowboarder, skier, or cross-country skiing
      this is your dream place.

    <h3>
      This website is your unofficial guide to making the best of your winter
      trip to Austria. You'll find here the best tips for travel, resorts to
      visit, and enjoying your trip. All information will be based out of
      Innsbruck. My main place of residence is near Tivoli Stadium and routes
      will be based out of there.

      In the travel section will be information regarding transportation to and
      from Innsbruck. The city has a massive transit center connecting buses,
      trains, and city trams. Munich is one of the largest & closest
      international airports. I will explain flying into here, getting a train
      to Innsbruck, and explaining the main Innsbruck transportation hub.
